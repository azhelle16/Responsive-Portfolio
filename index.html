			<p id="p1">I was born in San Francisco, California on the 24th of July 1987 but I was raised in the Philippines. I am the eldest among twin daughters and the only children in the family. I finished Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in University of the Philippines - Los Ba&ntilde;os. My hobbies include watching classic movies and TV series - mostly crime-solving genres, reading novels, listening to music and dreaming about the future.</p>
			<p>I love to travel and enjoy the view of the scenery but I also prefer to be at home. If not listening to music, I just love to take a long good sleep. Speaking of travelling, my dream vacation would be in Paris, France - sipping coffee and eating bread with my loved one in front of the Eiffel Tower.</p>
			<p>My love of programming started during my Sophomore year in college when my professor asked me to create a website. Ever since, not only do I love web designing but I also love critical thinking. I love to solve problems and dream to create a technology that would be useful in the future. I'm planning to take my Masters in the future majoring in IT and minoring in Computer Forensics.</p>
